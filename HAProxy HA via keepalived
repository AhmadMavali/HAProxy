Install HAProxy and Keepalived on both servers: Make sure you have HAProxy and Keepalived installed on both servers that will be part of the HA setup. You can use your package manager to install these tools.
Configure HAProxy: Edit the HAProxy configuration file (haproxy.cfg) on both servers. Specify the backend servers and any other settings you need. Make sure to listen on the same port on both servers.
Configure Keepalived: Edit the Keepalived configuration file (keepalived.conf) on both servers. Here's an example configuration:
On Server 1:
   vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
       script "killall -0 haproxy"
       interval 2
       weight 2
   }

   vrrp_instance VI_1 {
       state MASTER
       interface eth0
       virtual_router_id 51
       priority 101
       advert_int 1
       authentication {
           auth_type PASS
           auth_pass your_password
       }
       virtual_ipaddress {
           192.168.0.100
       }
       track_script {
           chk_haproxy
       }
   }

On Server 2:

   vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
       script "killall -0 haproxy"
       interval 2
       weight 2
   }

   vrrp_instance VI_1 {
       state BACKUP
       interface eth0
       virtual_router_id 51
       priority 100
       advert_int 1
       authentication {
           auth_type PASS
           auth_pass your_password
       }
       virtual_ipaddress {
           192.168.0.100
       }
       track_script {
