Install HAProxy and Keepalived on both servers: Make sure you have HAProxy and Keepalived installed on both servers that will be part of the HA setup. You can use your package manager to install these tools.
Configure HAProxy: Edit the HAProxy configuration file (haproxy.cfg) on both servers. Specify the backend servers and any other settings you need. Make sure to listen on the same port on both servers.
Configure Keepalived: Edit the Keepalived configuration file (keepalived.conf) on both servers. Here's an example configuration:
On Server 1:
   vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
       script "killall -0 haproxy"
       interval 2
       weight 2
   }

   vrrp_instance VI_1 {
       state MASTER
       interface eth0
       virtual_router_id 51
       priority 101
       advert_int 1
       authentication {
           auth_type PASS
           auth_pass your_password
       }
       virtual_ipaddress {
           192.168.0.100
       }
       track_script {
           chk_haproxy
       }
   }

On Server 2:

   vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
       script "killall -0 haproxy"
       interval 2
       weight 2
   }

   vrrp_instance VI_1 {
       state BACKUP
       interface eth0
       virtual_router_id 51
       priority 100
       advert_int 1
       authentication {
           auth_type PASS
           auth_pass your_password
       }
       virtual_ipaddress {
           192.168.0.100
       }
       track_script {
           chk_haproxy
       }
   }




Adjust the interface, virtual IP address, authentication password, and other settings according to your environment.
Start Keepalived: Start Keepalived on both servers using the appropriate command for your system. For example, you can use systemctl start keepalived on systems that use systemd.
Test the setup: Once Keepalived is running on both servers, you should be able to access the virtual IP address (192.168.0.100 in the example) from any client. Verify that the requests are being load balanced between the backend servers.
By following these steps, you should be able to configure high availability between HAProxy and Keepalived. Remember to adjust the configuration according to your specific requirements and network setup.
