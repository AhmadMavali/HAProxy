#In this example:
#The global section defines global settings for HAProxy, including logging, user and group permissions, and daemon mode.
#The defaults section sets default configuration options for all subsequent frontends and backends. It includes settings for logging, HTTP mode, timeouts, and various HTTP options.
#The frontend section named http_frontend is created to handle incoming HTTP traffic on port 80.
#The bind directive specifies that HAProxy should listen on all IP addresses (*) on port 80.
#The mode http directive sets the mode to HTTP.
#The default_backend directive specifies that incoming requests should be forwarded to the backend named http_backend if no other rules match.
#The backend section named http_backend defines the backend servers and their configuration.
#The balance directive is set to dynamic for dynamic load balancing based on weights.
#The dynamic-cookie-key directive sets the cookie key name used for dynamic weight assignments.
#The dynamic-cookie-show-url-param directive specifies the URL parameter to be included in the dynamic weight cookie's value.
#The dynamic-cookie-use-url-param directive specifies the URL parameter to be used for updating the dynamic weight.
#The dynamic-cookie-update-interval directive defines the interval at which HAProxy updates the dynamic weights based on URL parameter values.
#The server directives define the backend servers, specifying their IP addresses and ports, using the check option to enable health checks, and assigning initial weights.
#Please adjust the IP addresses, ports, and backend server configurations to match your specific environment and requirements. You can add or remove backend servers as needed.
#Remember to ensure that HAProxy is properly installed and configured on your system before using this configuration file.
