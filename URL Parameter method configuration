#In this example:
#The global section defines global settings for HAProxy, including logging, user and group permissions, and daemon mode.
#The defaults section sets default configuration options for all subsequent frontends and backends. It includes settings for logging, HTTP mode, timeouts, and various HTTP options.
#The frontend section named http_frontend is created to handle incoming HTTP traffic on port 80.
#The bind directive specifies that HAProxy should listen on all IP addresses (*) on port 80.
#The mode http directive sets the mode to HTTP.
#The default_backend directive specifies that incoming requests should be forwarded to the backend named http_backend if no other rules match.
#The backend section named http_backend defines the backend servers and their configuration.
#The balance directive is set to roundrobin for round-robin load balancing.
#The option http-server-close directive enables HTTP connection closing after each request/response cycle.
#The option forwardfor directive adds the X-Forwarded-For header to the backend server's request, indicating the original client's IP address.
#The http-request set-header directive sets the X-Forwarded-Port header to the destination port of the request.
#The http-request add-header directive adds the X-Forwarded-Proto header with a value of https if the incoming request is received over HTTPS.
#The http-request set-path directive modifies the request path, removing the /api/v1/ prefix.
#The http-request set-query directive modifies the request query parameters, rearranging the order of the id and name parameters.
#The server directives define the backend servers, specifying their IP addresses and ports, and using the check option to enable health checks.
#Please adjust the IP addresses, ports, and backend server configurations to match your specific environment and requirements. You can add or remove backend servers as needed.
#Remember to ensure that HAProxy is properly installed and configured on your system before using this configuration file.
